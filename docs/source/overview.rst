Overview
========

Gimel.js is a free & open-source library for easy DOM manipulation & effects library, written in pure javascript with no dependancies.

 | Gimel.js is not just another attempt at copying/re-creating jQuery, though! :).


Notes
------

 | Gimel.js can be freely mixed with any JavaScript and can be used with other libraries (such as jQuery).
